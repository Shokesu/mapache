# mapache

#### Work in progress, not much done yet.

There are lots of Python packages out there, but none for elections, polls, and other politics-related data visualization. Let´s code it.

Heavily influenced by [@kikollan](https://twitter.com/kikollan) plots for [El Español](http://www.elespanol.com/kiko_llaneras/).

For some of the current features see [/examples/features](https://github.com/cesans/mapache/blob/master/examples/features.ipynb).

TODOs

* Plots, yeah
* Smart color selections to avoid clashes
* Automatic label placement to avoid overlaps
* Name matching between polls and parties
